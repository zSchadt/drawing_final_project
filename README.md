##### Outline

I have always loved video games, specifically the aspect of exploring new worlds.
My goal is to create my own "sci-fi" realms. Each realm will have a portal
back to the main page. I will most likely use three.js for 3D emphasis in my drawings.
Each portal will lead to a surreal realm,
created from a combination of three.js, blending, css, and javascript based animation.
I hope to create surreal environments that appear to be alien to the viewer. To help
accomplish this attempt to mix 3D and 2D elements to give the user a feeling of space. Each "portal"
(exit link from current page) will be some sort of abstract 3D shape or grouping of
shapes that react to the user via actions like moving the mouse, or hovering over
the exit link. The shapes will be created from either many basic geometries or
created using a software for more complex shapes. The response action will be a sort
of "activating" of the portal, by either a lighting change or movement of the 3D
shapes. On top of all of this, I will use the css blending modes to layer on different
colors and motion like fog or snow.
